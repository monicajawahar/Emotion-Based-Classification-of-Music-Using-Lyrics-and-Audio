# Emotion-Based-Classification-of-Music-Using-Lyrics-and-Audio

The main objective of this project is to build a model for Music Emotion Recognition(MER) using both components of music which is lyrics and audio by comparing various preprocessing methods, feature engineering technique and applying various classification models to 16k lyrics and audio data.

Objective is to classify the music into 4 classes of emotion based on Russellâ€™s V-A model: sad, angry, happy and calm.

The accuracy by integrating the result from lyrics and audio data was 90.14%
